            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional 
                cricketer who was captain of the Indian national cricket team in 
                limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 
                2008 to 2014. He is a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman. He led 
                the team to three ICC trophies including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 
                2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Under his captaincy, 
                India won the Asia Cup two times, in 2010 and 2016. India also won ICC Test 
                Championship Mace two times in 2010 and 2011 under his leadership. 
                He is considered as one of the greatest Captains and Wicket Keeper-Batsmen
                 of all time. Throughout his 15 year long international career, Dhoni has

            <p>He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season,
                 especially in the One Day format and was picked for the
                  India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. Against 
                  the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best 
                  wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match.
                   In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A,
                    Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan
                     A with a half-century. Continuing his good performance, he scored back
                      to back centuries – 120[65] and 119*[66] – against the same team. Dhoni 
                      scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance
                       in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – 
                       Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.</p>
